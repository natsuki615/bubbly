## Inspiration

Bubbly was born from a desire to appreciate non-verbal language and create an entertaining way to learn something new. By combining technology with education, Bubbly transforms ASL practice into an engaging, visual experience that celebrates the beauty of sign language.

## What It Does

Bubbly uses your webcam to track your right hand in real-time and recognizes ASL finger-spelled letters. As you sign, letters appear on screen. When the letters you've signed form actual words or word prefixes, they automatically connect together visually, creating a satisfying and educational feedback loop.
This visual connection system helps learners to see immediate feedback on their signing, improve awareness of specific gestures and angles, and understand word formation in a unique, interactive way.

## Tech Stack

- **p5.js** - Creative coding framework for visualization and interaction
- **TensorFlow.js** - Machine learning model for hand pose detection and ASL recognition
- **MediaPipe** - Real-time hand landmark detection

## Features

- **Real-time Recognition** - Instant ASL letter detection using your right hand
- **Smart Word Detection** - Automatically identifies when signed letters form valid words or prefixes
- **Visual Connections** - Letters dynamically connect on screen when they form meaningful combinations
- **Educational & Entertaining** - Learn ASL through interactive, visual feedback
